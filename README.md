# MULTICOMM-Multi-threaded-Client-Server-Communication-using-TCP-UDP
MULTICOMM is a multi-threaded client-server application developed in Java using socket programming, supporting real-time text-based messaging over both TCP and UDP protocols. This project demonstrates the differences between reliable, connection-oriented communication (TCP) and fast, connectionless communication (UDP) through a practical implementation involving multiple clients and concurrent server threads.

### Key Features

-  Supports **real-time messaging** over both TCP and UDP
-  Multi-threaded server to handle **concurrent client connections**
-  TCP:
  - Reliable, ordered, full-duplex communication
  - Persistent connections
-  UDP:
  - Fast, stateless messaging
  - Low resource usage and latency
